# CodeRefactorBootCamp

Week 1 Code Refactoring assignment for BootCamp

Code Refactor Project

Description

This repository includes a code refactoring assignment. 

Refactoring existing code is a common task for junior developers. For this assignment, our class was asked to refactor an "existing" website (website sample code provided by instructor), while also making it accessible.

Refactoring this website corrected inactive links, provided a more visually pleasing layout and structure, and added accessibility features.

This assignment provided more experience working with HTML and CSS and helped our class learn what elements to identify for improvement and how to make those improvements.

This assignment followed the below User Story and Acceptance Criteria:

User Story:
As a marketing agency, I want a codebase that follows accessibility standards so that our own site is optimized for search engines.

Acceptance Criteria:
Given a webpage meets accessibility standards:
when I view the source code then I find semantic HTML elements; 
when I view the structure of the HTML elements then I gind tha thte elements follow a logical strcuture independent of styling; 
when I view the image elements then I find accessible alt attributes; 
when I view the heading attributes then they call in sequential order; 
when I view the title element then I find a concise and descriptive title.
